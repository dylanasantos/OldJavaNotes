The 4 key values that make an object oriented programming language:
-Inheritance (refer to superAndSubClasses)
-Encapsulation
-Abstraction
-Polymorphism

Encapsulation and Abstraction:
//Encapsulation and Abstraction are two of the four key values that make an object oriented programming language like java unique

Encapsulation:
//Putting something away, like a class

Abstraction
//Pulling something out, like instantiating a class

Polymorphism:
//Definition: One that can take multiple forms

//Polymorphism simply means that we are able to slightly morph our code, more or less think about classes and subclasses,
//Subclasses can override methods from a Parent class yet it's still similar to the original code

//Another example is overloading, where we have two methods that have the same name, but different parameters



Overloading vs Overriding:

Overloading:
//Multiple methods with the same name, but different parameter values

Overriding:
//Multiple methods with the same name and parameter values, but different classes


Some Data Types To Remember:

byte: -128 to 127
//Originally used for concerns on processing power, however not as important now

short: -32,768 to 32,767

int: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

long: -9,223,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807



How Static Works:
//Static refrences the class as a whole when being used, instead of an individual object

//For example: A static variable would be a variable for the class

//A static method is one that can be called without creating an object
//This would be called by using the class as such:
className.staticObject();

//Static variables are the only ones able to access static variables, but cannot access non-static variables
//Same applies to methods



Do while loops:

example:
int x = 7;
do { //Runs this code
    x *= 2;
} while (x < 28); //Checks if it's true or false, if still true it will re-run the do

//The difference between a do while and a regular while is that the do will run atleast once, since it does not check till the code
//is run

Infinite while loop:

while(true){
    //code
}
//The Reason this is infinite is because it's say while true is true, which it always will be
//If you wanted to exit the infinite loop, just use break;

//An infinite loop can also be done with variables:
example:

boolean number = false;
while(!number){ //Will run for as long as it is NOT number (false)
    //code
}

//While loops are always marked as true



How to record a time frame:

long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
long totalTimme = endTime - startTime;



Packages:

/*
Packages are a way we keep items oragnized in Java. While it's not as useful for smaller programs with only a few classes,
when you get to bigger programs with hundreds of classes the use of a package is vital.

(Examples in binarySearching and sorting class)
In order to create a package, simply write at the top package packageName; and VS Code will automatically create that package
and put the class in it. To add others simply drag and drop them inside

However it will no longer be accessed by default under the src package, meaning you have to import it like a regular import.

There is also package protected methods, this is a method not defined as private nor public. but left as: */

void methodExample(){
    //code
}

//This method can only be accessed by those in the same package, refer to sorting.java for more examples

Applying Final:
/*
 * Final can be used for various reasons:
 * -Preventing child classes (applied to classes)
 * -Preventing modification of value (applied to variables)
 * -Preventing modification of the method from a child class (applied to methods)
 * ^^^
 * Final variables are not written in standard camelCasing, rather all caps and underscores (i.e VARIABLE_NAME)
 */

 Important Java Methods:

 Integer.parseInt("Number"); //Turns a String into a number (Will error out if impossible)

 Access modifiers:
 //No declaration: only accessible to those inside it's package
 //public: accessible to all inside the java project folder
 //protected: accessible to all inside the java project folder IF it is a subclass of that class
 //private: onnly accessible to the class

 Every wrapper Class:
    (Wrapper classes are the non-primitive form of our data types)

byte = Byte
short = Short
int = Integer
long = Long 
float = Float 
double = Double 
boolean = Boolean 
char = Character
